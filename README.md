# 2023-Design
2023 Robot CAD

This space is reserved for the Solidworks CAD development and final files. The repository is designed to work hand in hand with the associated project (2023 Build). As CAD files are updated, assigned tasks should be updated per the project details. 

The space is controlled by hardware, manufacturing and design team members. Build team leaders have ownership and are responsible for the upkeep and active updates of the repository and project. Build mentors will have full access to help verify progress and assist team leaders with assigning and tracking tasks.
